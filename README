REDIS Server SNMP Agent.

PREAMBLE
========

redis-snmp is a Redis Net-SNMP agent written in Perl, and using the Net-Snmp 
Perl bindings.

It connects to a redis server and returns information to Net-SNMP when needed.
It parses the Redis INFO command results.

This work is based on Baron Schwartz Mysql Cacti Templates, available at:
http://code.google.com/p/mysql-cacti-templates/

This software is released under the GPL v2.

REQUIREMENTS
============

This package requires Net-SNMP version 5.4.3 or better. Previous versions have bugs preventing
returning 64 bits MIBs objects correctly from a perl agentX.

INSTALL
=======

Debian
------

Please build the package:
$ dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -uc- b

and install it
Then, modify /etc/default/redis-snmp

Other
-----

Modify the Makefile, and:
$ sudo make install

Then create an init.d startup script. You can look to the debian one
in debian/init.d

Install the MIB file in your mibs directory.

CONFIGURE
=========

Configure net-snmp
------------------

Add:
master agentx
to /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf, and restart snmpd
Make sure the redis-snmp agent is able to open the agentX socket (permissions
and location of said socket can be managed with the snmpd.conf agentXPerms
directive).

Configure redis-snmp
--------------------

Under debian, the daemon can be configured with /etc/default/redis-snmp.
On all platform, the configuration is done with command line arguments:

-h|--host HOST          connect to redis HOST
-P|--port PORT          port to connect to (default 6379)
-p|--password DBPASS   use DBPASS as password to connect to redis
--oid OID               registering OID
-i|--refresh            refresh interval in seconds

OPENNMS
=======

You'll find in the opennms directory the various configuration snippets
that can be used to let opennms graph the value reported by this agent.

datacollection-config.xml
-------------------------

Add the content of opennms/redis.datacollection-config.xml to
your datacollection-config.xml file.

Then add this group to your hosts:
<systemDef name="Net-Snmp">
  <sysoidMask>.1.3.6.1.4.1.8072.3.</sysoidMask>
  <collect>
    <includeGroup>mib2-host-resources-system</includeGroup>
    <includeGroup>mib2-host-resources-memory</includeGroup>
    <includeGroup>net-snmp-disk</includeGroup>
    <includeGroup>ucd-loadavg</includeGroup>
    <includeGroup>ucd-memory</includeGroup>
    <includeGroup>ucd-sysstat</includeGroup>
    <includeGroup>redis</includeGroup>
  </collect>
</systemDef>

And now, add the graph definitions from the opennms/redis.snmp-graph.properties file 
to your snmp-graph.properties.
